# Explanations
# F0401: "Unable to import", not needed since most code wont be in scope anyway
# C0111: "Missing docstring", this one is annoying as it warns of missing module docstrings
# C0103: "Invalid canstant name", don't tell me how I name my constants or what _is_ a constant
# W0232: "Class has no __init__ method", Not all classes will ya dingus
# R0903: "Classes aren't meant to store data", sure they are
# R0901: "too-many-ancestors", sometimes we'll have a lot of them, deal with it
# E1101: "X has no Y member", it might, just dynamically
# W0141: "Used builtin function x", I'll use map and reduce all I want
# W0201: "Attribute defined outside __init__"
# C0330: "Unmatched indentation", I like this type of indentation
# W0613: "Unused argument", this one is a pain in the ass and is sometimes wrong
# R0201: "Method could be a function", sometimes we use self, sometimes we dont
# W0212: "Access to a protected member of x", we're all adults here
# W0142: "star-args", I love star args
# W0703: "broad-exception", sometimes you just want to play pokemon programming and catch em all
# R0911: "too-many-return-statements", dont tell me how to return things
# R0912: "too-many-branchs", sometimes I edit somebody elses code and it sucks, get over it
# W0401: "wildcard-import", use these a good amount, it's not a bad pattern in moderation
# W0614: "unused-wildcard-import", come on bud, that's gonna happen
# E1103: "maybe-no-member", some subclasses wont enumerate their parent class's members
# R0904: "too-many-public-methods", tests are gonna have this
# R0913: "too-many-arguments", sometimes you shell out to ffmpeg and have a lot of args, deal with it
# W0622: "redefining built in", sometimes we have a kwarg of id, it happens bud
# E0213: "no-self-argument", this will sometimes be the case when using the @classmethod decorator
# E0710: "raising-non-exception", shut up
# E1002: "super-on-old-class", that happens sometimes
# C1001: "old-style-class", again, sometimes I don't want to inherit from anything (eg Meta)
# W0110: "deprecated-lambdas", I like lambdas
# E0611: "no-name-in-module", That's normal, code isn't always going to be installed where I'm editing it
# C0325: "superfluous-parens", python3 babe
# W0223: "abstract-method", sometimes mixins happen
# C0411: "wrong-import-order", I know what I'm doing
# C0321: "multiple-statements"
